#A Little Background on the Calculations#

In this program, pi is calculated using randomly generated points, all having x and y values between 0 and 1.
You can check out this article from Wired that explains it a little more (https://www.wired.com/2010/03/on-the-8th-day-god-made-pi/)
but here is the gist.
  
Basically, if we take a bunch of points with coordinates between 0 and 1, we can classify them as within the unit circle
or within the unit square. Then, knowing that the unit circle comprises Ï€/4 of the area of the unit square. Therefore it follows
that the number of points within the circle divided by the total number of points generated will be approximate to 1/4 pi.
