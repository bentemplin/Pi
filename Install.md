#Install Guide#
  
To install this software, there are two possibilites. You can either download the straight .class files and run them as is, or 
download the source code and compile it yourself. *Downloading the source code will let you play with (edit) the programs if 
you want.*

*Change the directory to the one with the .class files.*  
```cd /path_to_directory_with_class_files/```  
  
*Run the program*  
```java Pi```  
  
##Downloading, Compiling, and Running from Source Code##
